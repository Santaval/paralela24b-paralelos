## Build

In order to build the solution, the following must be done:

* Open a terminal and locate it in the folder called porject1-1 of the project.
* In this terminal you have to type the following command "make".
* This command will completely construct the solution of the task.

## Execution

To run the program, you have to do the following:

* Open a terminal and locate it in the folder called porject1-1 of the project.
* In this terminal you have to type the following command "make run".
* This command will compile and execute the task solution.
* In this step you can just type make run to compile by default
  * You can also add the port and threads to execute manually(For more help type bin/project1-1 help).

### Example input:
* make run
* make run 8080 6

### Example of output:
* Info    webserver       Listening on 0.0.0.0 port 8080


## Finish the web

To finish the connection to the web, you have to go to the terminal and put ctrl + c.
# User manual

This part is to be able to explain the use of the website.
* When you or someone connected to the web you are going to see to differents parts.
* The first one is for factorial, you have to enter a number in the blank, you can put:
  * One number, several numbers followed by commas and negatives.
  * Cannot place blank spaces.
* The second one is for goldbach, is very similar than factorial, but you are gona have the goldbach conjeture.

# Design

Concurrent web server, which follows the producer consumer pattern and lets a user factor or golbach some number

  

For more information about the design see the design folder.

# Concurrency Test

You can test the concurrency of the project using [httperf]([httperf/httperf: El generador de carga HTTP httperf (github.com)](https://github.com/httperf/httperf))

The comands that you need for the test are:
* $ ip addr | grep -E '\b\d+(\.\d+){3}\b'
* $ bin/webserv 8080 30 70
* $ httperf --server 10.137.1.117 --port 8080 --num-conns 200 --rate 50 --num-call 3 --uri /fact?number=123 --timeout 1

On the github page you will see how to install and read the data that this tool gives when using these commands
